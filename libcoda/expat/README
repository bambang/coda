These files are taken from Expat, Release 2.2.6.

The source files have been slightly modified in order to fit them into this
build system. The changes that were made are:

 - Source files now only include config.h (instead of a choice of
   expat_config.h, winconfig.h, etc.).

 - expat_external.h includes coda_expat_mangle.h to name mangle all
   public symbols.

 - Add define for BYTEORDER based on WORDS_BIGENDIAN.

 - Add define for XML_POOR_ENTROPY since we don't need high quality entropy.
